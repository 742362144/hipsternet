# Hipster Neural Net
All the hipster things in Neural Net in a single repo: hipster optimization algorithms, hispter regularization, everything!

Note, things will be added over time, so not all the hipsterest things will be here immediately.

## How to run this?

1. Install miniconda <http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html>
2. Do `conda env create`
3. Enter the env `source activate neuralnet`
3. Do things with the code if you want to
4. Run `python run.py`
5. Just close the terminal if you done (or `source deactivate`, not a fan though)

## What can I do with this?

Do anything you want. I licensed this with Unlicense License <http://unlicense.org>, as I need to take a break of using WTFPL license.
